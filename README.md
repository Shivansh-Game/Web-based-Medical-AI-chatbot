A proof-of-concept AI chatbot designed to provide accessible healthcare information to rural and semi-urban populations in India, bridging the information gap with modern language models.

## üéØ About The Project

This project is an AI-powered chatbot created to educate users on essential health topics. Leveraging a powerful language model running locally, it provides conversational answers to questions about preventive healthcare, disease symptoms, and vaccination schedules. The backend is a high-performance FastAPI server, and it's integrated with Twilio for WhatsApp functionality.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Git
* A pre-downloaded GGUF model file for BioMistral-7B, change the model_path variable in sns.py and main.py to the model you're using

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Shivansh-Game/Web-based-Medical-AI-chatbot.git](https://github.com/Shivansh-Game/Web-based-Medical-AI-chatbot.git)
    cd Web-based-Medical-AI-chatbot
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    * Add your Twilio credentials if you plan to use the WhatsApp functionality:
        ```env
        TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid
        TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token
        ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload -- port 8000
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## üîÆ Future Work

* [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud service like AWS EC2.
* [ ] Fine-tune the model on a custom dataset of Indian healthcare FAQs for higher accuracy.
* [ ] Implement a proper database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store conversation history.
* [ ] Expand the knowledge base to include more specialized health topics.
